          “We shifted our focus entirely on digital last year. We wanted to
          deliver a better experience for our clients, and build a sustainable
          solution that would exist with or without our studios open — which led
          us to Vimeo OTT. We were so hyper motivated to stay connected, we
          built Y7 Online in about three to four weeks.”
